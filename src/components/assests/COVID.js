			"question":"What is corona virus",
			"answer":"Corona viruses are a large family of viruses which may cause illness in animals or humans. In humans, several coronaviruses are known to cause respiratory infections ranging from the common cold to more severe diseases such as Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). The most recently discovered coronavirus causes coronavirus disease COVID-19. "

			"question":"What is COVID-19",
			"answer":"COVID-19 is the infectious disease caused by the most recently discovered corona virus. This new virus and disease were unknown before the outbreak began in Wuhan, China, in December 2019. "
		},
		{
			"id":2,
			"question":"What are the symptoms of COVID-19",
			"answer":"The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are fever, tiredness, and dry cough. Some patients may have aches and pains, nasal congestion, runny nose, sore throat or diarrhea. These symptoms are usually mild and begin gradually. Some people become infected but don’t develop any symptoms and don't feel unwell. Most people (about 80%) recover from the disease without needing special treatment. Around 1 out of every 6 people who gets COVID-19 becomes seriously ill and develops difficulty breathing. Older people, and those with underlying medical problems like high blood pressure, heart problems or diabetes, are more likely to develop serious illness.People with fever, cough and difficulty breathing should seek medical attention. "

		{
			"id":3,
			"question":"How does COVID-19 spread",
			"answer":"People can catch COVID-19 from others who have the virus. The disease can spread from person to person through small droplets from the nose or mouth which are spread when a person with COVID-19 coughs or exhales. These droplets land on objects and surfaces around the person. Other people then catch COVID-19 by touching these objects or surfaces, then touching their eyes, nose or mouth. People can also catch COVID-19 if they breathe in droplets from a person with COVID-19 who coughs out or exhales droplets. This is why it is important to stay more than 1 meter (3 feet) away from a person who is sick. "
		},
		{
			"id":4,
			"question":"Can the virus that causes COVID-19 be transmitted through the air? ",
			"answer":"Studies to date suggest that the virus that causes COVID-19 is mainly transmitted through contact with respiratory droplets rather than through the air. See previous answer on “How does COVID-19 spread?”"
		},
		{
			"id":5,
			"question":"Can CoVID-19 be caught from a person who has no symptoms? ",
			"answer":"The main way the disease spreads is through respiratory droplets expelled by someone who is coughing. The risk of catching COVID-19 from someone with no symptoms at all is very low. However, many people with COVID-19 experience only mild symptoms. This is particularly true at the early stages of the disease. It is therefore possible to catch COVID-19 from someone who has, for example, just a mild cough and does not feel ill. "
		},
		{
			"id":6,
			"question":"Can I catch COVID-19 from the feces of someone with the disease? ",
			"answer":"The risk of catching COVID-19 from the feces of an infected person appears to be low. While initial investigations suggest the virus may be present in feces in some cases, spread through this route is not a main feature of the outbreak. The ongoing research on the ways COVID-19 is spread and will continue to share new findings. Because this is a risk, however, it is another reason to clean hands regularly,after using the bathroom and before eating. "
		},
		{
			"id":7,
			"question":"How likely am I to catch COVID-19?",
			"answer":"The risk depends on where you are - and more specifically, whetherthere is a COVID-19 outbreak unfolding there.For most people in most locations the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. However, there are now places around the world (cities orareas) where the disease is spreading. For people living in, or visiting,these areas the risk of catching COVID-19 is higher. Governments and health authorities are taking vigorous action every time a new case of COVID-19 is identified. Be sure to comply with any local restrictions on travel, movement or large gatherings. Cooperating with disease control efforts will reduce your risk of catching or spreading COVID-19.COVID-19 outbreaks can be contained and transmission stopped, as has been shown in China and some other countries. Unfortunately,new outbreaks can emerge rapidly. It’s important to be aware of the situation where you are or intend to go. "

		{
			"id":8,
			"question":"Should I worry about COVID-19?",
			"answer":"Illness due to COVID-19 infection is generally mild, especially for children and young adults. However, it can cause serious illness:about 1 in every 5 people who catch it need hospital care. It is therefore quite normal for people to worry about how the COVID-19 outbreak will affect them and their loved ones.We can channel our concerns into actions to protect ourselves, our loved ones and our communities. First and foremost among these actions is regular and thorough hand-washing and good respiratory hygiene. Secondly, keep informed and follow the advice of the local health authorities including any restrictions put in place on travel,movement and gatherings."
		},
		{
			"id":9,
			"question":"Who is at risk of developing severe illness",
			"answer":"While we are still learning about how COVID-2019 affects people,older persons and persons with pre-existing medical conditions (suchas high blood pressure, heart disease, lung disease, cancer or diabetes) appear to develop serious illness more often than others. "
		},
		{
			"id":10,
			"question":"Are antibiotics effective in preventing or treating the COVID-19?",
			"answer":"No. Antibiotics do not work against viruses, they only work on bacterial infections. COVID-19 is caused by a virus, so antibiotics do not work. Antibiotics should not be used as a means of prevention or treatment of COVID-19. They should only be used as directed by a physician to treat a bacterial infection. "
		},{
			"id":11,
			"question":"Is there a vaccine drug or treatment for COVID-19",
			"answer":"Not yet. To date, there is no vaccine and no specific antiviral medicine to prevent or treat COVID-2019. However, those affected should receive care to relieve symptoms. People with serious illness should be hospitalized. Most patients recover thanks to supportive care. Possible vaccines and some specific drug treatments are under investigation. They are being tested through clinical trials.The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue, and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing "
		},{
			"id":12,
			"question":"Should I wear mask to protect myself",
			"answer":"Only wear a mask if you are ill with COVID-19 symptoms (especially coughing) or looking after someone who may have COVID-19.Disposable face mask can only be used once. If you are not ill or looking after someone who is ill then you are wasting a mask. There is a world-wide shortage of masks, so We urge people to use masks wisely.We advises rational use of medical masks to avoid unnecessary wastage of precious resources and mis-use of masks The most effective ways to protect yourself and others against COVID-19 are to frequently clean your hands, cover your cough with the bend of elbow or tissue and maintain a distance of at least 1 meter (3 feet) from people who are coughing or sneezing. "
		},{
			"id":13,
			"question":"How long is the incubation period for COVID-19?",
			"answer":"The “incubation period” means the time between catching the virus and beginning to have symptoms of the disease. Most estimates of the incubation period for COVID-19 range from 1-14 days, most commonly around five days. These estimates will be updated as more data become available. "
		},{
			"id":14,
			"question":"Can humans become infected with the COVID-19 from an animal source?",
			"answer":"Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses that are common in animals. Occasionally, people get infected with these viruses which may then spread to other people. For example, SARS-CoV was associated with civet cats and MERS-CoV is transmitted by dromedary camels. Possible animal sources of COVID-19 have not yet been confirmed.To protect yourself, such as when visiting live animal markets, avoid direct contact with animals and surfaces in contact with animals.Ensure good food safety practices at all times. Handle raw meat, milk or animal organs with care to avoid contamination of uncooked foods and avoid consuming raw or undercooked animal products. "
		},{
			"id":15,
			"question":"How long does the virus survive on surfaces?",
			"answer":"It is not certain how long the virus that causes COVID-19 survives on surfaces, but it seems to behave like other corona viruses. Studies suggest that corona viruses (including preliminary information on the COVID-19 virus) may persist on surfaces for a few hours or up to several days. This may vary under different conditions (e.g. type of surface, temperature or humidity of the environment).If you think a surface may be infected, clean it with simple disinfectant to kill the virus and protect yourself and others. Clean your hands with an alcohol-based hand rub or wash them with soap and water. Avoid touching your eyes, mouth, or nose. "
		},{
			"id":16,
			"question":"Is there anything I should not do?",
			"answer":"The following measures ARE NOT effective against COVID-2019 and can be harmful: • Smoking • Wearing multiple masks • Taking antibiotics (See question 12 'Are there any medicines of therapies that can prevent or cure COVID-19?') "
